IliumROO runs on the current 1.9.2 p290 version of Ruby.

IliumROO includes a Gemfile that defines all of the gems IliumROO
depends on.

It is recomended that you install RVM and create a
gemset specifically for IliumROO.  Once your gemset is created
and you have activated it using the rvm use command, then run
"bundle install" to install dependencies.

Cassandra can be run at the command line using the gem itself, or
freshly built from the source.  I'd recommend building from the 
source, since that will pull in all of Cassandra's requirements.

In Cassandra's storage-conf.xml file, add the following lines into
the <Keyspaces> tag and restart Cassandra:

<Keyspace Name="IliumROO">
    <ColumnFamily CompareWith="UTF8Type" Name="objects"/>
	<ColumnFamily ColumnType="Super" CompareWith="UTF8Type"
			CompareSubcolumnsWith="UTF8Type" Name="object_tags"/>
	<ColumnFamily ColumnType="Super" CompareWith="TimeUUIDType"
			CompareSubcolumnsWith="UTF8Type" Name="log"/>
	<ReplicaPlacementStrategy>org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackUnawareStrategy</ReplicaPlacementStrategy>
	<ReplicationFactor>1</ReplicationFactor>
	<EndPointSnitch>org.apache.cassandra.locator.EndPointSnitch</EndPointSnitch>
</Keyspace>

If you are using Cassandra 0.7 or later, you can create the IliumROO
keyspace manually using the cassandra-cli command.  First, make sure
Cassandra is running, then from the IliumROO directory, issue
the following command:

$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/cassandra-cli -host YOUR_HOST -file schema.txt
