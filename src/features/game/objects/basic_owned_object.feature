Feature: basic owned object testing
  As a game I have players that want to own objects
  So I will have a base object that allows for ownership

  #Scenario: test getmode
  #  Given a mocked player object
  #  And a mocked arguments hash
  #  When I check the starting mode of the object
  #  Then I will get the DEFAULT mode
