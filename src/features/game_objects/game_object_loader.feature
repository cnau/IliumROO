Feature: game object loader
  As a game I need to load objects
  So that the game has stuff

  Scenario: test loading a class object
    Given a mock class setup
    When I load test class object
    Then I verify class structure

   Scenario: test loading an object derived from the above class
     Given a mock object setup
     When I load test class object
     And I load test object
     Then I verify object structure
